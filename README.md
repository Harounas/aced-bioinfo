# Unix 101
## Unix 101 Part 1 - files and directories
Concept: Terminal lets you access the Unix system that lies beneath the fancy Mac/Ubuntu GUI.

## Before we begin
- [x] Download the file from here:
- [ ] Double click on the file to uncompress it. It will create a directory (folder) call `UnixClass`.
- [ ] Drag the `UnixClass directory to the `Desktop` folder on your Mac/Windows machine.

## List directory contents and change working directory
| Run Terminal.app    | Find usinf Spotlight (/Applications/Utilities) |
| :---: | :---: |
| ls  | What's there?   |
| pwd | Where am I? |
| cd Desktop| Change directory|
| cd UnixClass | Tab to complete names |
| cd .. | change to parent directory |
| pwd | |
| ls /usr/bin | many of the utilities we are using "live" here |
| pwd | we haven't moved|
| ls UnixClass | list files in `Unixclass` directory |
| ls -l `UnixClass` | list the files in the Unixclass directory |
| cd  !$ | useful short-cut: last word of the previous cmd |
| ls -ltr | list files in order from oldest to newest ; not we can always combine single letter options|
| man ls | Manual (help) pages for most Unix commands|
